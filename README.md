Hi there! I’m Shambhavi Trivedi, a Computer Science undergraduate at SRM University, Lucknow.

💻 I’m passionate about building real-world solutions through Java development, web technologies, and clean UI/UX design. Whether it’s crafting a strategy game in JavaFX, managing data with MySQL, or designing wireframes in Figma, I love the entire creative process of turning ideas into working products.

🔧 I code mostly in Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++, and I enjoy experimenting with both frontend and backend tools. You’ll find projects here ranging from:

🎮 Greedy Duel Game (JavaFX)

🏥 Hospital Management System (Java + MySQL)

🗓️ Study Planner App (Swing + SQL)

🌐 Responsive Job Portals & Web Games

🌱 Currently learning: Open Source Collaboration, Backend APIs, and Advanced Java Patterns
🚀 Actively contributing to: Personal JavaFX projects & open-source initiatives
🌟 Fun Fact: I once helped improve a website's loading time by 30% during an internship!

Let’s connect and build cool things together — feel free to explore my repositories or drop me a message!
